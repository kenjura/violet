A CMS using flat text files (of varying formats) as a data store. Uses pure web standard technologies for frontend, and standard, minimalist technologies for backend. Mostly an academic exercise.

## Getting started
```shell
npm i
nvm use
npm start
```

Then navigate to localhost:3600 (or whatever you set the PORT to in .env.local)
